## Types and Classes

Type is a name for a collection of related values. 
Boolean type is called Bool
True and False of type Bool
Applying function to one or more arguments of the wrong type is called a type error. 

Type error can be found in compile time. Make safe programs

Bool
Char
String
Int - fixed precision integers
Integer- arbitrary precision integers
Float 

list is sequence of values that have the same type. 

[False, True] :: [Bool]
['a', 'b'] :: [Char]
[['a'], ['b', 'c']] :: [[Char]]

Can have list of arbitrary types:
Example:
[[[char]]]

Tuples:

(1, True, 'c') :: (int, Bool, Char) \\ Values can be different types. 

Function Types:

Function is mapping from values of one type to values of another type. 

not :: Bool -> Bool

isDigit :: Char -> Bool

In lambda expression
\x -> ..x..

add :: (Int, Int) -> Int

add(x, y) = x + y

Func <T> equivalent to () -> T

Func <S, T> equivalent to S -> T

Action <T> equivalent to T -> ()

add = \(x,y) -> x + y

In Haskell, we write in a curried fashion
add: Int -> (Int -> Int)
add x y = x + y

add takes a int which returns function which takes int and returns int

Can write as add x = \y -> x + y
//Also a curried function

mult :: Int -> (Int -> (Int -> Int))

mult x y z = x * y * z

can be written as f:: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int creates less noise. 

We can used curried function for partially applying. 

(f 3) becomes Int -> Int -> Int

((f(3) 2) 1) 

mult x y z
means ((mult x) y) z
Unless tupling is explicity required, all functions in Haskell are normally defined in curried form 

Polymorphic functions:

A function is called Polymorphic (of many forms) if its type contains one or more type variables. 

length :: [a] -> Int
for any type a, length takes the list of values and returns an integer


Many of the functions defined in the standard prelude are Polymorphic.
For Example:

fst ::(a, b) -> a
head :: [a] -> a
take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]

zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]

id :: a -> a

zip is a curried function takes list of a and list of b and returns list of pairs. 

Takes a pair of list and returns list of pair. 

Classes in haskell. 

sum :: [a] -> a

we need some constraints here. 

sum :: Numa => [a] -> a //Implements the Num interface. 
Both Int and Float implement the numeric interface. 

Haskell has a number of type classes, including:
Num: Numeric Types
Eq: Equality Types
Ord - Ordered Types

Example:

(+) ::Num a => a -> a -> a //only a's that have num inteface. 

(==) :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool 

(<) :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool 

Useful Tips
When defining a function, it is useful to begin by writing down its type
