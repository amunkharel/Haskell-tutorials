## Functional Parsers

A parser is a program that analyses a piece of text to determine its syntatic structure. 

Parser a = String -> [(a, string)]
if nothing, returns empty list and returns value if something in list. 

item :: Parsar Char
::String -> [(char, String)]
::[Char] -> [(Char, [Char])]
